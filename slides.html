# Useful Scala

---

# Agenda

1. Motivation
1. Example System
1. ADTs
1. Pure functions
1. Sequencing Computation

---

# Motivation

Scala gives us a lot of language features and libraries to use.

It can be overwhelming.

My main goal here is to run through a simple program, and show some basic ways of thinking
that hopefully illustrate fundamentals of functional programming.

---

# Example system

.center[![Right-aligned image](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/stone-for-rock/Diagram.png)]

---

# Goal

Test this system.

1. Send request.
2. Store request.
3. Get response.
4. Check result was correct.

---

# ADTs

Representing data in code, in the simplest way possible.
The fundamental building blocks of data structures. Modelling data as logical ands and ors.

### Requests
```scala
case class Request(id: JobId, value: Int, webhookUrl: String)

case class JobId(value: String)
```

These exist independent of any http connections that may exist

---

# ADTs

### Requests that have been sent
```scala
sealed trait DispatchedRequest
case class FailedRequest(e: Throwable) extends DispatchedRequest
case class SuccessfulRequest(request: Request) extends DispatchedRequest
```

* DispatchedRequest is the data type
* Case class are the instances of that data type.


This means that we should write functions that look like:
```scala
def log(dispatchedRequest: DispatchedRequest): Unit = ???
```

not functions like:
```scala
def log(successfulRequest: SuccessfulRequest): Unit = ???
```
^ writing functions like this, we are side skerting the type system.
Not using it to its full potential.
This is a quirk of the collision between functional and object oriented programming

---

# ADTs

### Responses
```scala
sealed trait Response {
  val id: JobId
}
case class CompletedComputation(id: JobId, results: List[Int]) extends Response
case class FailedComputation(id: JobId, message: String) extends Response
```

---

# Combinators

Using ADTs makes it easy to write simple combinators:

```scala
sealed trait DispatchedRequest {
  def fold[A](failed: Throwable => A, success: Request => A): A = this match {
    case FailedRequest(e)       => failed(e)
    case SuccessfulRequest(req) => success(req)
  }
}
case class FailedRequest(e: Throwable) extends DispatchedRequest
case class SuccessfulRequest(request: Request) extends DispatchedRequest
```

For example:

```scala
def submitDispatchedRequest(req: DispatchedRequest): Task[Unit] = Task {
  req.fold(
    e   => println(s"error dispatching request: $e"),
    req => store = store + (req.id -> req)
  )
}
```

---

# Pure Functions

Where ever possible, try to write pure functions:

```scala
case class Check(expected: ExpectedResults) {

  def check(request: Request, response: Response): CheckResult = {
    val reqVal = request.value
    expected.get(reqVal).fold(
      Pass(request, response))(
      vals =>
        // put more here
        Pass(request, response)
    )
  }
}
```

* Easier to understand
* Easy to test
* Naturally segment code
* Scala provides powerful combinators to combine them


They tend to be easier to understand.
They are easier to test, I can just feed in parameters and check the output.
Scala's functional combinators makes it easy to apply them (as we will see).
They can also be easily combined with a almost all Scala combinators.

---

# Sequencing Computation

Lets you combine computations that are happening in a context. Examples:

```scala
def getJobId: Throwable \/ JobId = ???
def getResponse(id: JobId): Throwable \/ Response = ???

...

val response: Throwable \/ Response = for {
  id   <- getJobId
  resp <- getResponse(id)
} yield resp
```

This translates directly to:

```scala
val response = getJob.flatMap(id => getResponse(id))
```

Here we should think of flatMap with the type signature:

  `M[A] flatMap (A => M[B]) : M[B]`

In the above, 'M[A] === Throwable \/ A'

---

# Task

Another computation in a context that is very useful is Task.
It captures the description of a program, without running it.
The running of the program happens at the edge of your program.
(Makes it easier to think about what the task is doing, versus when
it gets run, ie submitted to executor service.)

(I don't understand the underlying mechanism for how it works, I just know that it works
and it produces pretty clean code!)

Here is a simple example.

```scala
val task = Task.delay(1)
def multiplyBy2(x: Int): Task[Int] = Task(x * 2)
def log(x: Int): Task[Unit] = Task(println(x))

...

val program = for {
  x <- task
  result <- multiplyBy2(x)
  _ <- log(result)
} yield ()
program.unsafePerformSync
```

---

# Task

Here is an example our client testing case:

```scala
// sends the request, holds exceptions that may occur
def dispatch(request: Request): Task[DispatchedRequest] = ???
...
def submitRequest(dispatchedRequest: DispatchedRequest): Task[Unit] = ???
...
def dispatchAndSubmit(request: Request): Task[Unit] = {
  for {
    dispatched <- dispatch(request)
    _ <- submitRequest(dispatched)
  } yield ()
}
```
