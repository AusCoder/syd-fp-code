# Example using Scala

# Intro

- Me: Sebastian Mueller

- Work at: ImageIntelligence
  - Use Scala for our backend services.

- Code/Slides: https://github.com/AusCoder/syd-fp-code

# Agenda

1. Motivation
1. Example System
1. ADTs
1. Pure functions
1. Sequencing Computation

---

# Motivation

Scala gives us a lot of language features and libraries to use.

It can be overwhelming.

I want to show a program that uses the parts of Scala that I think are valuable.

???

My main goal here is to run through a simple program, and show some basic ways of thinking
that hopefully illustrate fundamentals of functional programming.

---

# Example system

.center[![Right-aligned image](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/stone-for-rock/Diagram.png)]

---

# Goal:

Test this system.

##Strategy:

1. Send request.
2. Store request.
3. Get response.
4. Check result was correct.

---

# ADTs

* Representing data in code.
* Modelling data as logical ands and ors.
* The fundamental building blocks of data structures.

### Requests
```scala
case class Request(id: JobId, value: Int, webhookUrl: String)

case class JobId(value: String)
```

???

These exist independent of any http connections that may exist

---

# ADTs

### DispatchedRequests
```scala
sealed trait DispatchedRequest
case class FailedRequest(e: Throwable) extends DispatchedRequest
case class SuccessfulRequest(request: Request) extends DispatchedRequest
```

* DispatchedRequest is the data type
* Case class are the instances of that data type.



Functions should look like:
```scala
def log(dispatchedRequest: DispatchedRequest): Unit = ???
```

Not like this:
```scala
def log(successfulRequest: SuccessfulRequest): Unit = ???
```

???

^ writing functions like this, we are side skerting the type system.
Not using it to its full potential.
This is an unfortunate quirk of the collision between functional and object oriented programming

---

# ADTs

### Responses
```scala
sealed trait Response {
  val id: JobId
}
case class CompletedComputation(id: JobId, results: List[Int]) extends Response
case class FailedComputation(id: JobId, message: String) extends Response
```

---

# Combinators

We can write simple combinators:

```scala
sealed trait DispatchedRequest {
  def fold[A](failed: Throwable => A, success: Request => A): A = this match {
    case FailedRequest(e)       => failed(e)
    case SuccessfulRequest(req) => success(req)
  }
}
case class FailedRequest(e: Throwable) extends DispatchedRequest
case class SuccessfulRequest(request: Request) extends DispatchedRequest
```

For example:

```scala
def submitDispatchedRequest(dispatchedRequest: DispatchedRequest): Task[Unit] =
  Task {
    dispatchedRequest.fold(
      e => println(s"error dispatching request: $e"),
      req => {
        store.put(req.id, req)
        ()
      }
    )
  }
```

???

we now have data, and some functions to help combine data.
Now it is time to look at how we can combine data using functions.

---

# Pure Functions

* Easier to understand
* Easy to test
* Scala provides powerful combinators to combine them

```scala
case class Check(expected: ExpectedResults) {

  def runCheck(request: Request, response: Response): CheckResult = {
    val reqVal: Int = request.value
    val expectedResultsOpt: Option[List[Int]] = expected.get(reqVal)
    expectedResultsOpt.fold[CheckResult](
      Pass(request, response))(
      vals =>
        response match {
          case FailedComputation(_, _) => Fail(request, response, "received failed computaiton")
          case CompletedComputation(_, results) => {
            if (vals == results) Pass(request, response)
            else Fail(request, response, "values didn't match")
          }
        }
    )
  }
}
```

???

Where ever possible, try to write pure functions:

They tend to be easier to understand.
They are easier to test, I can just feed in parameters and check the output.
Scala's functional combinators makes it easy to apply them (as we will see).
They can also be easily combined with a almost all Scala combinators.

---

# Sequencing Computation

* Combine computations that are happening in a context.

```scala
def getJobId: Throwable \/ JobId = ???
def getResponse(id: JobId): Throwable \/ Response = ???

...

val response: Throwable \/ Response = for {
  id   <- getJobId
  resp <- getResponse(id)
} yield resp
```

This translates directly to:

```scala
val response = getJob.flatMap(id => getResponse(id))
```

flatMap type:

  `(Throwable \/ A) flatMap (A => (Throwable \/ B)) : (Throwable \/ B)`

???

In the above, 'M[A] === Throwable \/ A'

---

# scalaz.Task

* Represents async IO operation
* Serves similar purpose to scala.concurrent.Future
* Captures description of program without running it
* Same Task can be run many times

```scala
val task = Task.delay(1)
def multiplyBy2(x: Int): Task[Int] = Task(x * 2)
def log(x: Int): Task[Unit] = Task(println(x))

...

val program = for {
  x      <- task
  result <- multiplyBy2(x)
  _      <- log(result)
} yield ()
program.unsafePerformSync
```

flatMap has this type signature:

```scala
Task[A] flatMap (A => Task[B]): Task[B]
```

???

They can be sequenced together using flatMap and/or for comprehension.
The above for comprehension desugars to something like:
`task.flatMap(x => multiplyBy2(x).flatMap(result => log(result).map(_ => ()))`

Here flatMap has the type signature:

```scala
Task[A] flatMap (A => Task[B]): Task[B]
```

???

I think that reading the type signature gives us a lot of clues about how
we can compose functions)

Another computation in a context that is very useful is Task.
It captures the description of a program, without running it.
The running of the program happens at the edge of your program.
(Makes it easier to think about what the task is doing, versus when
it gets run, ie submitted to executor service.)

(I don't understand the underlying mechanism for how it works, I just know that it works
and it produces pretty clean code!

---

# scalaz.Task

* Used by http4s when making or receiving http requests.

```scala
// sends the request, holds exceptions that may occur
def dispatch(request: Request): Task[DispatchedRequest] = ???
...
def submitRequest(dispatchedRequest: DispatchedRequest): Task[Unit] = ???
...
def dispatchAndSubmit(request: Request): Task[Unit] = {
  for {
    dispatched <- dispatch(request)
    _          <- submitRequest(dispatched)
  } yield ()
}
```

???

http4s is a library for making and receiving http requests.
It makes use of scalaz.Task
It follows a similar functional mindset to scalaz. (eg separating the description of
a web server from actually starting a server. This allows for greater composability.)

---

# scalaz.Task

* We use combinators to apply our pure functions to values in Tasks.

```scala
def liftedRunCheck(request: Request, response: Response): Task[CheckResult] =
  Task {
    check.runCheck(request, response)
  }

def submitResponse(response: Response): Task[Unit] = {
  getFromStore(response.id).fold(
    Task(println("response with no matching request")))(
    request => liftedRunCheck(request, response).flatMap(reportResults)
  )
}

def reportResults(result: CheckResult): Task[Unit] = Task {
  println(result)
}
```

???

here I am taking my pure function `runCheck` and lifting it into a Task.
When this is run, it will execute the function and the result will be held in a Tak.
From there, I am reporting the result.
The important bit is that everything it happening inside a Task. We are using the combinators
(mainly flatMap) on Task to sequence the computations together.

# Final thoughts

Given a problem, think about how to represent it using types.

Think about how data moves through a program.

Read the types!

???

Simple is great

Gives clues about what functions will be needed


they give a lot of clues to what things do, and how to compose them
